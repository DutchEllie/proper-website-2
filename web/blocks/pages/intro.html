	Welcome to my webspace! Whether you stumbled across this page by accident
	or were linked here, you're more than welcome! This is my personal project that I like
	to work on! I was inspired by a couple friends of mine, please do check their webspaces
	out as well under "Galaxies" on the left side there!
	If you like this page, there is a lot more, so have a look around! You can also leave a
	nice message for me in the guestbook! There is no registration (unlike the rest of the "modern"
	internet) so nothing of that sort!
	That said, this website is my creative outlet and a way to introduce myself, so be kind please!
	Also its code is entirely open-source and can be found
	<a href="https://dutchellie.nl/DutchEllie/proper-website-2">on my personal Gitea instance</a> so if you like that
	sort
	of stuff, be my guest it's cool!
</p>

	There is a lot of stuff I want to add to this website! In fact, there is also a "staging" website, which might
	contain
	new features! It can be found at <a href="https://newsite.staging.dutchellie.nl">newsite.staging.dutchellie.nl</a>.
	Don't worry about the invalid SSL certificate, that's normal!
