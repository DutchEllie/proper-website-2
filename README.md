[![Build Status](https://drone.nicecock.eu/api/badges/DutchEllie/proper-website-2/status.svg)](https://drone.nicecock.eu/DutchEllie/proper-website-2)

A truly proper website this timeâ„¢

**TODO**:
- Change domain to quenten.nl and staging.quenten.nl
- Dynamically make domains for other branches
- Make a generic page component, so that you don't have to add the standard panels every time (such as navbar, leftbar, header, etc)


This website will be done with this:
- Backend written in Golang
- Templating with Go
- Database connection for comments and such
- Markdown article writing

It will be done in the following order:
- First get up a working simple proof of concept
- Then make the comments better
- Database better
- Layout
- Markdown article writing
- Layout
